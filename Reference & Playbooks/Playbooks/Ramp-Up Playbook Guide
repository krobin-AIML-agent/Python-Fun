# Python Playbooks 📘  

This repository contains my **Python playbooks** — step-by-step resources designed to guide execution, bridge fundamentals to advanced concepts, and ensure repeatability in real-world projects.  

Unlike static references, these are **action-oriented guides**: structured workflows and deeper explorations into higher-order Python skills.

## 📂 Repository Structure  

### 1. Data Analyst Line Item (Micro-Steps).xlsx  
A structured **checklist and workflow map** for common data analyst tasks.  
- Breaks down large projects into **repeatable micro-steps**.  
- Designed to ensure precision, reduce errors, and create consistency in execution.  

**Example use cases:**  
- ETL pipeline → Extract → Transform → Load  
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) workflow  
- SQL → Python → Visualization alignment  

**Why it matters:**  
- Ensures **no missed steps**  
- Speeds up **onboarding and training**  
- Builds **repeatable and auditable routines**

### 2. Key Advanced Topics.ipynb  
A Jupyter Notebook dedicated to **bridging beginner → intermediate → advanced Python.**  
- Explores **higher-order concepts** skipped in most tutorials.  
- Provides **hands-on runnable examples** for real-world problem solving.  

**Example topics:**  
- Decorators and generators  
- Context managers  
- Error handling patterns  
- SQLAlchemy engine creation & database handling  
- Advanced data structures  

**Why it matters:**  
- Prepares for **real-world coding challenges**  
- Improves **efficiency, readability, and maintainability**  
- Acts as a **bridge between learning and execution**
