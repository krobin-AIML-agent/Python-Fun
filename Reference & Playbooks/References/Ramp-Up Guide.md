# Python Reference Toolkit ðŸ“˜  

This repository is my **Python reference system** â€” a structured collection of **dictionaries, one-liners, and runnable notebooks** designed to speed up recall, improve efficiency, and provide ready-made examples for common coding tasks.

## ðŸ“‚ Contents  

### 1. Python Dictionary.xlsx (Reference)  
A structured **lookup table** of Python commands, functions, and terminology.  

**Categories:**  
- String operations (`.split()`, `.join()`)  
- Data handling (`pandas`, `numpy`)  
- File I/O basics (`open()`, `.read()`, `.write()`)  

**Purpose:**  
A quick **cheat sheet** for when you need to refresh syntax or concepts without searching docs.  

---

### 2. Python Master One Liners (Code Efficiency).csv (Reference)  
A CSV of **Python one-liners** that condense multi-line solutions into single statements.  

**Examples include:**  
- Flattening nested lists  
- Finding duplicates in arrays  
- Filtering dictionaries  
- Reversing strings and lists  

**Purpose:**  
Save time with **clean, elegant, and efficient shortcuts.**

### 3. Functionality Reference Sheet.ipynb (Reference + Runnable)  
A Jupyter Notebook with **runnable code snippets.**  

**Covers:**  
- File handling (CSV, Excel, JSON)  
- Loops and comprehensions  
- API requests  
- Web scraping basics  
- Data cleaning routines  

**Purpose:**  
An **encyclopedia of working examples** â€” copy, adapt, and execute directly.

## ðŸŽ¯ Purpose  

This toolkit acts as:  
- A **personal memory bank** for syntax and patterns.  
- A **speed booster** for repetitive coding tasks.  
- A **teaching/reference resource** for others learning Python.

## ðŸ”‘ How to Use  

- For quick recall â†’ open **Python Dictionary.xlsx**  
- For efficient coding â†’ check **Python Master One Liners.csv**  
- For runnable examples â†’ use **Functionality Reference Sheet.ipynb**  

---

## ðŸš€ Who Will Benefit  

- **Self-learners** â†’ need a structured reference system  
- **Data analysts/scientists** â†’ working in pandas/SQL integrations  
- **Developers** â†’ wanting clean and efficient one-liners  
- **Anyone learning Python** â†’ looking for applied, not abstract, references
