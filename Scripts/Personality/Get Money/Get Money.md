Python-Fun: Playbooks & Computational Thinking 🧩

This repository collects my Python experiments that blend computational thinking, playbooks, and interactive metaphors. Each project is designed to feel lightweight and playful while teaching deeper concepts like decomposition, abstraction, constraints, and user interaction.

📂 Included Projects

1. Forever Young 🕰️

A playful logic model that reimagines the "age problem" into a computational system.

Core Ideas:

Decomposition → Breaks the problem into input, constraint (cap at 30), path selection (A or B), and output (forever 21).

Pattern Recognition → Sees equivalence: both 30 - 9 and 20 + 1 converge on 21.

Abstraction → Simplifies messy real-world ages into rules:

< 30 = actual age

≥ 30 = 21

Algorithm Design → Step-by-step flow:

Take input (age)

Apply constraint (>30 masked)

Prompt user for Path A or B

Always resolve to 21

Why It Matters:

Demonstrates autonomy vs. system constraints (user “chooses” a path, but backend enforces outcome).

Models how UX and CS design blend: autonomy within guardrails.

Encodes systems thinking: Input → Constraint → Path → Output

2. Get Money 💸

A simple but symbolic script about goals and persistence.

Munyun = int(input("How much money you got right now? "))
target = 100000

if Munyun < target:
    print("Go get some money!")
else:
    print("Go get some money!")


Core Ideas:

Constraint Logic → No matter how much you have, the outcome reinforces the same behavior: “Go get some money.”

Metaphor → Persistence and ambition modeled in code.

Interactive Prompt → Makes the script feel conversational with the user.

Why It Matters:

Shows how even trivial scripts encode mindset.

Captures the spirit of continuous pursuit — aligning with learning, CI, and life goals

🎯 Purpose of This Repo

A sandbox for computational metaphors.

Reference material for thinking about algorithms beyond math.

Lightweight demos that can be extended into teaching aids, UX models, or process playbooks.

🚀 Who Will Benefit

Learners: See how abstract CS concepts can be reframed in human metaphors.

Analysts / Engineers: Quick reference for systems thinking encoded in Python.

Educators: Examples of teaching logic through playful metaphors.
