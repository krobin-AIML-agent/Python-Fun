# Forever Young

A playful Python script that turns age into a mindset. It shows that youth is about perspective, not years.

---

**Project Overview**  
The script asks for your age and then reframes it. If the age is above 30, it masks it back to 30. You then pick a path (A or B), and both lead to the same outcome: **21 → Forever Young**.

**Code Walkthrough**  
- **Input Prompt:** Asks the user for their age.  
- **Logic:**  
  - If age > 30 → it resets to 30.  
  - If age ≤ 30 → keeps your real input.  
- **Choice:**  
  - Path A → 30 - 9 = 21  
  - Path B → 20 + 1 = 21  
- **Message:** No matter the path, you stay forever young.  

---

**Purpose**  
- Symbolic reminder that youth is perspective, not age.  
- Practice with Python basics: input, conditionals, branching logic.  
- Delivers encouragement at the end: *Life is hard. Remember to keep your youth.*
