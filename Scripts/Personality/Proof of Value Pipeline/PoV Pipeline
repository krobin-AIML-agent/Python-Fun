# ✅ Proof of Value Pipeline

This project transforms **years of experience** into a measurable system of **proof nodes** — showing not just time spent, but value delivered. It blends Python, career strategy, and continuous improvement into a decision engine.

---

**📌 Project Overview**  
Most people say: *“I have 10 years of experience.”*  
This pipeline asks: *“What proof do you actually have from those 10 years?”*  

The program converts **years → hours → proof of value** by decomposing time into **direct vs. indirect work** and validating outcomes.

**📝 Code Walkthrough**  
- **Step 1: Customer Route** → Select from profiles (student, transitioning professional, veteran, entrepreneur, contractor).  
- **Step 2: Input** → Enter years of experience, which is converted into total hours (~2,000 hrs/year).  
- **Step 3: Process** → Allocate hours into **direct work** (corporate deliverables) and **indirect work** (personal projects, learning, portfolio).  
- **Step 4: Validation** → Check if proof exists (direct or indirect).  
- **Step 5: Binary Decision** →  
  - If ≥1 proof node exists → **“Proof of Value Achieved.”**  
  - Else → **Loop back and refine.**

**⚡ Purpose**  
- Moves beyond surface-level claims (*years of experience*) into **evidence-driven outputs**.  
- Bridges **continuous improvement**, **data pipelines**, and **career strategy** into one executable system.  
- Encodes **Definition of Done** as proof nodes (dashboards, diagnostics, frameworks, deliverables).
