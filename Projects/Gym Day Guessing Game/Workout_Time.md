# Gym Guessing Game

A fun Python command-line game where you try to guess the workout of the day — leg day, chest day, arm day, or back day.

**File:** `Gym_Guessing_Game.py` 

---

**How It Works**
- The program randomly picks a workout (leg, chest, arms, or back).
- You enter your guess.
- It tells you if you nailed it or if it’s "not today" (but still a good day to train ).
- After each round, you can choose to play again.

---

**Purpose**
- Demonstrates Python fundamentals like:
  - Loops (`while`)
  - User input validation
  - Random module usage
  - Basic game logic
- A lighthearted way to practice coding while reinforcing fitness culture.
