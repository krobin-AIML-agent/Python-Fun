# Human OS (Kevin Robinson)

A Python-based framework that encodes **traits, applied skills, and mental models** into an operating system for decision-making. It acts as a **contextual engineering engine**, helping simulate how different skills are deployed depending on audience and timing.

**Project Overview**  
This project reimagines a human skillset as an **operating system**.  
It blends:  
- **Base Traits** → always deployed (agility, adaptability, authenticity, etc.)  
- **Applied Skills** → deployed based on context (Operations, Technical, Finance, Executive, AI, Program Management, Continuous Improvement)  
- **Mental Models** → universal overlays (pattern recognition, meta cognition, dependency mapping, etc.)  
- **Timing Logic** → adjusts outputs depending on when the script is run (too early, perfect timing, timing caught up).  

---

**Code Walkthrough**  
- **deploy_skillset()**: Core function that combines traits, applied skills, and mental models.  
- **print_deployment_report()**: Creates a structured diagnostic output.  
- **run_prompt_sequence()**: Interactive mode → user chooses audience (Operations, Finance, AI, etc.) and the program generates a full contextual deployment report.  
- **go_get_it()**: Simple mindset function reminding you: *Go get it.*

**Purpose**  
- Models a **Human OS** → turning soft skills, technical skills, and mental models into data objects.  
- Helps illustrate **contextual adaptability** → what to deploy depending on the team or scenario.  
- Acts as a **career + AI metaphor** → the idea that humans, like systems, load the right modules at the right time.

**How to Run**  
1. Clone the repo:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Human-OS.git
   cd Human-OS

**Key Takeaway**

This project demonstrates intentionality, adaptability, and proof of value in code.
It bridges:

- Meta-level thinking (mental models)
- Operational execution (applied skills)
- Core humanity traits (authenticity, resilience, agility)
